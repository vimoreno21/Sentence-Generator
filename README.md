# Sentence-Generator
String, File Opener, and Array Project


     This project is similar to my Story Creator project, except this one is written in java and only creates sentences. 
     The project also decomposes sentences and checks if sentences are of the correct form. Some challenges in this 
     project were learning how to split user inputted sentences and how to open, read, and use files.
